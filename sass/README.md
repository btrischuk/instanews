Instanews is a webpage created for a school project at RED Academy.  It uses API's to generate data from the New York Times and was built as per the perameters specified for the project.

## The Process
This project challenged me a lot with JQuery.  Throughout the project 

has allowed me to develop my knowledge of mostly CSS and Javascript. I have become much more familiar with the tools required to accomplish these tasks and more efficient when it comes to refactoring.
