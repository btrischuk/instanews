##Description
Instanews is a webpage created for a school project at RED Academy.  It uses API's to generate data from the New York Times and was built as per the perameters specified for the project.

## The Process
This project presented many fun challenges and allowed me to learn how to use a few new tools throughout.  The main components were JavaScript, SASS, and Jquery.
